### Data for the `StatisticalModel` class

The folder `csv` contains the CSV files obtained by the `ExtractFeatures` class and from the surprisal estimation using both `extract_surprisal_gpt2_pipe.py` and `extract_surprisal_bert_pipe.py`. These files serve as input for GLMs in the `StatisticalModel` class.
